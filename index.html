<p> Me and my team worked together to creat an animation to show how homless people can just be ingnore as if they arent a human or even as if they dont exist. We show how its really about the quality of the people because in our play we have a sucessful buisness man walk by a homless man and gives him money trying to get him back on his feet as hundreads of other people just walk by as he isnt there. </p>
<p> Our process consisted of storyboardsa dn creating loopy seen above and then cogitating about how we will add code and animation to our animation to bring it to life. </p>
    <p> We </p>

<p> We finally came up with a way to use code in different wasy to use servos and codes and motors. </p>

    <p> These photos are picture of our code along with a behind the scenes during our build. We were able to compleatly build the set but couldnt finish up by puting the curcit boards on the play but will be finished within the week. </p>n. 
    <p> The code shows the subject of what will be changed in these cases they wll be the servo and the other will be the light board. It then tell how they will be activated. for the light Its activaed by start meaning it will be on and always on once turned on and having a power source. For the other It is activated on the press of a button. Lastly they show for the light what brightness it will be shown with and in our case that will be 255. This is how our code works. </p>

    <p> This photo above shows another behind the scenes photo of our process of what each person will do and what is done or being done ect. </p>

    <p>The photo above will be the last and is our latest photo of our animation because our project isnt finished but will be completed later. </p>
