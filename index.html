<p> Me and my team worked together to creat an animation to show how homless people can just be ingnore as if they arent a human or even as if they dont exist. We show how its really about the quality of the people because in our play we have a sucessful buisness man walk by a homless man and gives him money trying to get him back on his feet as hundreads of other people just walk by as he isnt there. </p>
<p> Our process consisted of storyboardsa dn creating loopy and then cogitating about how we will add code and animation to our animation to bring it to life. </p>
